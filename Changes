   Fix tests for when launched apps are already open.

* v1.70, June 4, 1999

   Cleaned up stuff.  Added SetFront, Show, Hide.  Fixed setting of
   $^E.  Improved QuitAllApps to not quit only normal apps by checking
   processType for "APPL".

* v1.60, September 28, 1998

   Added LaunchSpecs.  Use this when the app does not have a unique app ID,
   the app is not really an app (like the Finder), or you have more than one
   instance of the app, and want to launch a particular one.

* v1.50, September 16, 1998

   Added IsRunning.

* v1.40, August 3, 1998

   Only launches application if not already open; e.g., won't launch newer
   version it finds if older version is open.

* v1.31, May 18, 1998

   Added AEDisposeDesc call (D'oh!).  Dunno why I forgot this.

* v1.3, January 3, 1998

   General cleanup, rewrite of method implementation, no longer support
   versions prior to 5.1.4r4, addition of Quit methods, methods return
   undef on failure (most recent error in C<$^E>, but could be multiple
   errors; oh well).
