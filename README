This is Mac::Apps::Launch 1.0, a MacPerl application launcher.

REQUIREMENTS:
* Tested with MacPerl 5.1.1+ (different methods for MacPerl 5.1.4r4+).

To install it, just drop the file Launch.pm in the directory
lib:Mac:Apps.  The usage instruction are at the top of the module.

This archive can always be obtained from:

    http://pudge.net/macperl/
    http://perl.com/CPAN/authors/id/CNANDOR/
    http://perl.com/CPAN/modules/by-module/Mac/

The file is a tarred, gzipped file.  Use Stuffit Expander or a
similar program to get at the archive.

I think that is about it.  Let me know how things work out, and any
bugs, typos, suggestions, or anything else.
