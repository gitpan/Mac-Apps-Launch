NAME
    Mac::Apps::Launch - MacPerl module to launch applications

SYNOPSIS
        use Mac::Apps::Launch;
        my @apps = qw(R*ch Arch MPGP);
        LaunchApps([@apps], 1) || warn($^E); # launch and switch to front
        LaunchApps([@apps])    || warn($^E); # launch and don't switch 
        QuitApps(@apps)        || warn($^E); # quit @apps
        QuitAllApps(@apps)     || warn($^E); # quit all except @apps
        IsRunning('MACS');                   # returns boolean for whether
                                             # given app ID is running

DESCRIPTION
    Simply launch or quit applications by their creator ID. The Finder can
    be quit in this way, though it cannot be launched in this way.

    This module is used by several other modules.

    This module as written does not work with MacPerls prior to 5.1.4r4.

EXPORT
    Exports functions `QuitApps()', `QuitAllApps()', and `LaunchApps()'.

HISTORY
    v.1.50, September 16, 1998
        Added `IsRunning()'.

    v.1.40, August 3, 1998
        Only launches application if not already open; e.g., won't launch
        newer version it finds if older version is open.

    v.1.31, May 18, 1998
        Added AEDisposeDesc() (D'oh!). Dunno why I forgot this.

    v.1.3, January 3, 1998
        General cleanup, rewrite of method implementation, no longer
        support versions prior to 5.1.4r4, addition of Quit methods,
        methods return undef on failure (most recent error in `$^E', but
        could be multiple errors; oh well).
